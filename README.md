# exove_coding-test

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

run 
- npm install to install node modules
- npm start to start the program locally

I did parts: 1C, 2A, 3D.

I didn't know if using React was okay for the last one since it's HTML but writing more JSX. But I'm sure I'll hear at the interview :)
